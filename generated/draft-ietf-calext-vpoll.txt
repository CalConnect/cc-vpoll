          VPOLL: Consensus Scheduling Component for iCalendar
                       draft-ietf-calext-vpoll-05

Abstract

   This specification introduces a new RFC5545 iCalendar component which
   allows for consensus scheduling, that is, voting on a number of
   alternative meeting or task alternatives.

1.  Introduction

   The currently existing approach to agreeing on meeting times using
   iTip [RFC5546] and/or iMip [RFC6047] has some significant failings.
   There is no useful bargaining or suggestion mechanism in iTip, only
   the ability for a potential attendee to accept or refuse or to
   counter with a time of their own choosing.

Internet-Draft                    VPOLL                       April 2024


   Part of the problem is that for many potential attendees, their
   freebusy is not an accurate representation of their availability.  In
   fact, when trying to schedule conference calls across different
   organizations, attendees may not be allowed to provide freebusy
   information or availability as this may reveal something of the
   organizations internal activities.

   A number of studies have shown that large amounts of time are spent
   trying to come to an agreement - up to and beyond 20 working hours
   per meeting.  Many organizers fall back on other approaches such as
   phone calls and email to determine a suitable time.

   Online services have appeared as a result and these allow
   participants to vote on a number of alternatives without revealing or
   using freebusy or availability.  When agreement is reached a
   conventional scheduling message may be sent to the attendees.  This
   approach appears to reach consensus fairly rapidly.  Peer pressure
   may have some bearing on this as all voters are usually able to see
   the current state of the voting and may adjust their own meeting
   schedules to make themselves available for a popular choice.

   The component and properties defined in this specification provide a
   standardized structure for this process and allow calendar clients
   and servers and web based services to interact.

   These structures also have uses beyond the relatively simple needs of
   most meeting organizers.  The process of coming to consensus can also
   be viewed as a bidding process.

2.  Terms and definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   The notation used in this memo to (re-)define iCalendar elements is
   the ABNF notation of [RFC5234] as used by [RFC5545].  Any syntax
   elements shown below that are not explicitly defined in this
   specification come from iCalendar [RFC5545].

   Additionally the following terms are used:

2.1.  consensus scheduling

   The process whereby users come to some agreement on meeting or task
   alternatives and then book that meeting or task.

Internet-Draft                    VPOLL                       April 2024


2.2.  active Vpoll

   A VPoll may have a DTSTART, DTEND and DURATION which may define the
   start and end of the active voting period

2.3.  voter

   A participant who votes on the alternatives.  A voter need not be an
   attendee of any of the alternatives presented.

3.  Simple Consensus Scheduling

   This specification defines components and properties which can be
   used for simple consensus scheduling but also have the generality to
   handle more complex cases.  To provide an easy (and for many a
   sufficient) introduction to consensus scheduling and VPOLL we will
   outline the flow of information for the simple case of voting on a
   number of meeting alternatives which differ only in time of the
   meeting.  In addition the voters will all be potential attendees.

   This specification not only defines data structures but adds new iTip
   methods, one used when consensus has been reached and one to
   distribute the current status of the poll.

   This document will show how a VPOLL object is used to inform voters
   of the state of a simple vote on some alternatives.

3.1.  The VPOLL Component: An Overview

   The VPOLL component acts as a wrapper for a number of alternatives to
   be voted on, together with some properties and a new component used
   to maintain the state of the voting.  For our simple example the
   following VPOLL properties and sub-components are either required or
   appropriate:

   DTSTAMP  The usual [RFC5545] property.

   SEQUENCE  The usual [RFC5545] property.  See below for SEQUENCE
      behavior.

   UID  The usual [RFC5545] property.

   SUMMARY  The usual [RFC5545] property.  This optional but recommended
      property provides the a short title to the poll.

   DESCRIPTION  The usual [RFC5545] property.  This optional property
      provides more details.

Internet-Draft                    VPOLL                       April 2024


   DTEND  The usual [RFC5545] property.  This optional property provides
      a poll closing time and date after which the VPOLL is no longer
      active.

   POLL-MODE  A new property which defines how the votes are used to
      obtain a result.  For our use case it will take the value "BASIC"
      meaning one event will be chosen from the alternatives.

   POLL-COMPLETION  A new property which defines who (server or client)
      chooses and/or submits the winning choice.  In our example the
      value is "SERVER-SUBMIT" which means the client chooses the winner
      but the server will submit the winning choice.

   POLL-PROPERTIES  A new property which defines which icalendar
      properties are being voted on.  For our use case it will take the
      value "DTSTART, LOCATION" meaning only those properties are
      significant for voting.  Other properties in the events may differ
      but are not considered significant for the voting process.

   PARTICIPANT  There is one of these components for each voter with the
      PARTICIPANT-TYPE set to "VOTER".  The CALENDAR-ADDRESS property
      identifies the voter and this component will contain one VOTE
      component for each item being voted on.

   VOTE  A new component.  There is one of these for each voter and
      choice.  It usually contains at least a POLL-ITEM-ID property to
      identify the choice and a RESPONSE property to provide a vote.
      For more complex poll modes it may contain other information such
      as cost or estimated duration.

   VEVENT  In our simple use case there will be multiple VEVENT sub-
      components defining the alternatives.  Each will have a different
      date and or time for the meeting.

   EXAMPLE

   VPOLL with 3 voters and 3 alternative meetings:

   END:VPOLL

   As can be seen in the example above, there is an iTip METHOD property
   with the value REQUEST.  The VPOLL object will be distributed to all
   the voters, either through iMip or through some VPOLL enabled
   service.

3.2.  The VPOLL Alternative Choices: An Overview

   Within the VPOLL component we have the alternatives to vote on.  In
   many respects these are standard [RFC5545] components.  For our
   simple use case they are all VEVENT components.  In addition to the
   usual [RFC5545] properties some extra properties are used for a
   VPOLL.

   POLL-ITEM-ID  This provides a unique reference to the sub-component
      within the VPOLL.  It's value SHOULD be a small integer.

Internet-Draft                    VPOLL                       April 2024


3.3.  VPOLL responses

   Upon receipt of a VPOLL REQUEST the voter will reply with a VPOLL
   component containing their vote.  In our simple case it will have the
   following properties and components:

   DTSTAMP  The usual [RFC5545] property.

   SEQUENCE  The usual [RFC5545] property.  See below for SEQUENCE
      behavior.

   UID  Same as the request.

   SUMMARY  Same as the request.

   PARTICIPANT  One only with a CALENDAR-ADDRESS identifying the voter
      replying.

   VOTE  One per item being voted on.

   POLL-ITEM-ID  One inside each VOTE component to identify the choice.

   RESPONSE  One inside each VOTE component to specify the vote.

   Note that a voter can send a number of REPLYs for each REQUEST sent
   by the organizer.  in BASIC mode each REPLY completely replaces the
   voting record for that voter for all components being voted on.  In
   our example, if Eric responds and votes for items 1 and 2 and then
   responds again with a vote for only item 3, the final outcome is one
   vote on item 3.

   NOTE  This is poll-mode specific behavior.

3.4.  VPOLL updates

   When the owner receives a response from one or more voters the
   current state of the poll is sent to all voters.  The new iTip method
   POLLSTATUS is used.  The VPOLL can contain a reduced set of
   properties but MUST contain DTSTAMP, SEQUENCE (if not 0), UID, and
   one or more PARTICIPANT components each populated with zero or more
   VOTE components.

3.5.  VPOLL Completion

   After a number of REPLY messages have been received the poll will be
   considered complete.  If there is a DTEND on the poll the system may
   automatically close the poll, or the organizer may, at any time,
   consider the poll complete.  A VPOLL can be completed (and
   effectively closed for voting) by sending an iTip REQUEST message
   with the VPOLL STATUS property set to COMPLETED.

   The poll winner is confirmed by sending a final iTip REQUEST message
   with the VPOLL STATUS property set to CONFIRMED.  In this case the
   VPOLL component contains all the events being voted on along with a
   POLL-WINNER property to identify the winning event.  As the POLL-
   COMPLETION property is set to SERVER-SUBMIT the server will submit
   the winning choice and when it has done so set the STATUS to
   "SUBMITTED".

3.6.  Other Responses

   A voter being asked to choose between a number of ORGANIZER supplied
   alternatives may find none of them acceptable or may simply not care.

   An alternative response, which may be disallowed by the ORGANIZER, is
   to send back the respondees availability or freebusy or even one or
   more new, alternative choices.

   This is accomplished by responding with a VOTE component which has no
   POLL-ITEM-ID property.  In this case it MUST contain some alternative
   information.  What form this takes depends on the poll mode in
   effect.

4.  iCalendar Extensions

4.1.  Updated Participant Type Value

   Participant type property values are defined in section 11.2.1. of
   [RFC9073].  This specification updates that type to include the new
   participant type VOTER to provide information about the voter and to
   contain their votes.

Internet-Draft                    VPOLL                       April 2024


   Format Definition  This property parameter is redefined by the
      following notation:

   partvalue       /= "VOTER"

   Description  The new property value indicates that the associated
      PARTICIPANT component identifies a voter in a VPOLL.

4.2.  Updated Relation Type Value

   Relationship parameter type values are defined in section 3.2.15. of
   [RFC5545].  This specification updates that type to include the new
   relationship value POLL to provide a link to the VPOLL component in
   which the current component appears.

   Format Definition  This property parameter is redefined by the
      following notation:

   reltypeparam       /= "RELTYPE" "=" "POLL"
   ; Property value is a VPOLL uid

   Description  This parameter can be specified on a property that
      references another related calendar component.  The new parameter
      value indicates that the associated property references a VPOLL
      component which contains the current component.

4.3.  Updated Status Value

   Status property values are defined in section 3.8.1.11. of [RFC5545].
   This specification updates that type to define valid VPOLL status
   values.

   Format Definition  This property parameter is redefined by the
      following notation:

   statvalue /= statvalue-poll
      ; Status values for "VPOLL".
   statvalue-poll = "IN-PROCESS"
             / "COMPLETED"  ; Poll has closed,
                            ; nothing has been chosen yet
             / "CONFIRMED"  ; Poll has closed and
                            ; winning items confirmed
             / "SUBMITTED"  ; The winning item has been
                            ; submitted
             / "CANCELLED"

   Description  These values allow clients and servers to handle the
      choosing and submission of winning choices.

Internet-Draft                    VPOLL                       April 2024


      If the client is choosing and the server submitting then the
      client should set the POLL-WINNER property, set the status to
      CONFIRMED and save the poll.  When the server submits the winning
      choice it will set the status to SUBMITTED.

4.4.  New Property Parameters

4.4.1.  Required

   Parameter name  REQUIRED

   Purpose  To specify whether the associated property is required in
      the current context.

   Format Definition  This parameter is defined by the following
      notation:

   requirededparam = "REQUIRED"  "=" ("TRUE" / "FALSE")
     ; Default is FALSE

   Description  This parameter MAY be specified on REPLY-URL and, if the
      value is TRUE, indicates the organizer requires all replies to be
      made via the specified service rather than iTip replies.

4.4.2.  Stay-Informed

   Parameter name  STAY-INFORMED

   Purpose  To specify the voter also wants to be added as an ATTENDEE
      when the poll is confirmed.

   Format Definition  This parameter is defined by the following
      notation:

   stayinformedparam = "STAY-INFORMED"  "=" ("TRUE" / "FALSE")
                     ; Default is FALSE

   Description  This parameter MAY be specified on the CALENDAR-ADDRESS
      property in the PARTICIPANT component and, if the value is TRUE,
      indicates the voter wishes to be added to the final choice as a
      non participant.

4.5.1.  Accept-Response

   Property name  ACCEPT-RESPONSE

   Purpose  This property is used in VPOLL to indicate the types of
      component that may be supplied in a response.

   Property Parameters  Non-standard or iana parameters can be specified
      on this property.

   Conformance  This property MAY be specified in a VPOLL component.

   Description  When used in a VPOLL this property indicates what
      allowable component types may be returned in a reply.  Typically
      this would allow a voter to respond with their freebusy or
      availability rather than choosing one of the presented
      alternatives.

      If this property is not present voters are only allowed to respond
      to the choices in the request.

   Format Definition  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

   acceptresponse = "ACCEPT-RESPONSE" acceptresponseparams ":"
                       iana-token ("," iana-token) CRLF

   acceptresponseparams = *(";" other-param)

4.5.2.  Poll-Completion

   Property name  POLL-COMPLETION

   Purpose  This property is used in VPOLL to indicate whether the
      client or server is responsible for choosing and/or submitting the
      winner(s).

   Description  When a VPOLL is stored on a server which is capable of
      handling choosing and submission of winning choices a value of
      SERVER indicates that the server should close the poll, choose the
      winner and submit whenever it is appropriate to do so.

      For example, in BASIC poll-mode, reaching the DTEND of the poll
      could trigger this server side action.

      Server initiated submission requires that the submitted choice
      MUST be a valid calendaring component.

      POLL-COMPLETION=SERVER-SUBMIT allows the client to set the poll-
      winner, set the status to CONFIRMED and then store the poll on the
      server.  The server will then submit the winning choice and set
      the status to SUBMITTED.

   Format Definition  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

   poll-completion = "POLL-COMPLETION" pcparam ":" pcvalue CRLF

   pcparam = *(";" other-param)

   pcvalue = "SERVER"  ; The server is responsible for both choosing and
                      ; submitting the winner(s)
           / "SERVER-SUBMIT" ; The server is responsible for
                      ; submitting the winner(s). The client chooses.
           / "SERVER-CHOICE"  ; The server is responsible for
                      ; choosing the winner(s). The client will submit.
           / "CLIENT" ; The client is responsible for both choosing and
                      ; submitting the winner(s)
           / iana-token
           / x-name
           ;Default is CLIENT

   Example  The following is an example of this property:

   POLL-COMPLETION: SERVER-SUBMIT

4.5.3.  Poll-Item-Id

   Property name  POLL-ITEM-ID

   Purpose  This property is used in VPOLL child components as an
      identifier.

   Value type  INTEGER

   Property Parameters  Non-standard parameters can be specified on this
      property.

   Conformance  This property MUST be specified in a VOTE component and
      in VPOLL choice items.

   Description  In a METHOD:REQUEST each choice component MUST have a
      POLL-ITEM-ID property.  Each set of components with the same POLL-
      ITEM-ID value represents one overall set of items to be voted on.

Internet-Draft                    VPOLL                       April 2024


      POLL-ITEM-ID SHOULD be a unique small integer for each component
      or set of components.  If it remains the same between REQUESTs
      then the previous response for that component MAY be re-used.  To
      force a re-vote on a component due to a significant change, the
      POLL-ITEM-ID MUST change.

   Format Definition  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

   pollitemid = "POLL-ITEM-ID" pollitemdparams ":"
                     integer CRLF

   pollitemidparams = *(
                      (";" other-param)
               )

4.5.4.  Poll-Mode

   Property name  POLL-MODE

   Purpose  This property is used in VPOLL to indicate what voting mode
      is to be applied.

   Property Parameters  Non-standard or iana parameters can be specified
      on this property.

   Conformance  This property MAY be specified in a VPOLL component or
      its sub-components.

   Description  The poll mode defines how the votes are applied to
      obtain a result.  BASIC mode, the default, means that the voters
      are selecting one component (or group of components) with a given
      POLL=ITEM-ID.

      Other polling modes may be defined in updates to this
      specification.  These may allow for such modes as ranking or task
      assignment.

   Format Definition  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

   pollmode = "POLL-MODE" pollmodeparams ":"
                ("BASIC" / iana-token / other-token) CRLF

   pollmodeparams = *(";" other-param)

4.5.5.  Poll-properties

   Property name  POLL-PROPERTIES

   Purpose  This property is used in VPOLL to define which icalendar
      properties are being voted on.

   Property Parameters  Non-standard or iana parameters can be specified
      on this property.

   Conformance  This property MAY be specified in a VPOLL component.

   Description  This property defines which icalendar properties are
      significant in the voting process.  It may not be clear to voters
      which properties are varying in a significant manner.  Clients may
      use this property to highlight those listed properties.

   Format Definition  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

   pollproperties = "POLL-PROPERTIES" pollpropparams ":"
                text *("," text) CRLF

   pollpropparams = *(";" other-param)

4.5.6.  Poll-Winner

   Property name  POLL-WINNER

   Purpose  This property is used in a basic mode VPOLL to indicate
      which of the VPOLL sub-components won.

   Value type  INTEGER

   Property Parameters  Non-standard parameters can be specified on this
      property.

   Conformance  This property MAY be specified in a VPOLL component.

   Description  For poll confirmation each child component MUST have a
      POLL-ITEM-ID property.  For basic mode the VPOLL component SHOULD
      have a POLL-WINNER property which MUST correspond to one of the
      POLL-ITEM-ID properties and indicates which sub-component was the
      winner.

   Format Definition  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

          ; components have been confirmed

4.5.7.  Reply-URL

   Property name  REPLY-URL

   Purpose  This property may be used in scheduling messages to indicate
      additional reply methods, for example a web-service.

   Value type  URI

   Property Parameters  Non-standard, required or iana parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance  This property MAY be specified in a VPOLL component.

   Description  When used in a scheduling message this property
      indicates additional or required services that can be used to
      reply.  Typically this would be a web service of some form.

   Format Definition  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

   reply-url = "REPLY-URL" reply-urlparams ":" uri CRLF

   reply-urlparams = *(

   response = "RESPONSE" response-params ":" integer CRLF
                    ; integer value 0..100

   responseparams = *(";" other-param)

   Description  This parameter can be specified on the POLL-ITEM-ID
      property to provide the value of the voters response.  This
      parameter allows for fine grained responses which are appropriate
      to some applications.  For the case of individuals voting for a
      choice of events, client applications SHOULD conform to the
      following convention:

      *  0 - 39 A "NO vote"

      *  40 - 79 A "MAYBE" vote

      *  80 - 89 A "YES - but not preferred vote"

      *  90-100 A "YES" vote.

         Clients MUST preserve the response value when there is no
         change from the user even if they have a UI with fixed states
         (e.g. yes/no/maybe).

      The PARTICIPANT components in VPOLL requests provide information
      on each recipient who will be voting - both their identity through
      the CALENDAR-ADDRESS property and their votes through the VOTE
      components.

      If specified, the "DTSTART" property defines the start or opening
      of the poll active period.  If absent the poll is presumed to have
      started when created.

      If "DTSTART" is present "DURATION" MAY be specified and indicates
      the duration, and hence the ending, of the poll.  The value of the
      property MUST be a positive duration.

      "DTEND" MAY be specified with or without "DTSTART" and indicates
      the ending of the poll.  If DTEND is specified it MUST be later
      than the DTSTART or CREATED property.

      If one or more VALARM components are included in the VPOLL they
      are not components to be voted on and MUST NOT contain a POLL-
      ITEM-ID property.  VALARM sub-components may be used to provide
      warnings to the user when polls are due to start or end.

   Description  This component appears inside the PARTICIPANT component
      with a PARTICIPANT-TYPE of VOTER to identify the voter.  This
      component contains that participants responses.

      The required and optional properties and their meanings will
      depend upon the POLL-MODE in effect.

      For any POLL-MODE, POLL-ITEM-ID is used to associate the
      information to a choice supplied by the organizer.  This means
      that each VOTE component only provides information about that
      choice.

      If allowed by the POLL-MODE a VOTE component without a POLL-ITEM-
      ID may be provided in a REPLY to indicate a possible new choice or
      to provide information to the ORGANIZER - such as the respondees
      availability.

5.  Poll Modes

   The VPOLL component is intended to allow for various forms of
   polling.  The particular form in efffect is indicated by the POLL-
   MODE property.

   New poll modes can be registered by including a completed POLL-MODE
   Registration Template (see Section 11.3) in a published RFC.

5.1.  POLL-MODE:BASIC

   BASIC poll mode is the form of voting in which one possible outcome
   is chosen from a set of possibilities.  Usually this will be
   represented as a number of possible event objects one of which will
   be selected.

5.1.1.  Property restrictions

   This poll mode has the following property requirements:

   POLL-ITEM-ID  Each contained sub-component that is being voted upon
      MUST contain a POLL-ITEM_ID property which is unique within the
      context of the POLL.  The value MUST NOT be reused when events are
      removed and/or added to the poll.

   POLL-WINNER  On confirmation of the poll this property MUST be
      present and identifies the winning component.

5.1.2.  Outcome reporting

   To confirm the winner the POLL-WINNER property MUST be present and
   the STATUS MUST be set to CONFIRMED.

   When the winning VEVENT or VTODO is not a scheduled entity, that is,
   it has no ORGANIZER or ATTENDEES it MUST be assigned an ORGANIZER
   property and a list of non-participating ATTENDEEs.  This allows the
   winning entity to be distributed to the participants through iTip or
   some other protocol.

6.  New Participant Properties for iTip

   The following properties are defined to be used within PARTICIPANT
   during scheduling and take the place of ATTENDEE and ORGANIZER
   properties and parameters.  These are not solely for VPOLL but may be
   used in any future component.

6.1.  Kind

   Property name  KIND

   Purpose  This is what kind of entity this participant is, if known.

   Property Parameters  Non-standard or iana parameters can be specified
      on this property.

   Conformance  This property MAY be specified in a PARTICIPANT
      component.

Internet-Draft                    VPOLL                       April 2024


   Description  When used in a PARTICIPANT component this property
      indicates the kind of entity, individual, group etc.

      It takes the va;ues hown below which are a redefinition of the
      CUTYPE parameter values defined in [RFC5545] and aligned with
      [RFC8984] .

   Format Definition  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

   kind = "KIND" kindparams ":"
                   "INDIVIDUAL"   ; An individual
                 / "GROUP"        ; A group of individuals
                 / "RESOURCE"     ; A physical resource
                 / "LOCATION"     ; A location resource e.g a room
   known
                 iana-token ("," iana-token) CRLF

   kindparams = *(";" other-param)

6.2.  Redefined participation type

   This specification redefines the PARTICIPATION-TYPE property allowing
   it to take multiple values and extending those values to align with
   [RFC8984] roles and add a new "VOTER" role.  There are also changes
   to the description to clarify it's use defining the roles that
   participant takes.

   Property name  PARTICIPANT-TYPE

   Purpose  This property is equivalent to the [RFC5545] ATTENDEE ROLE
      parameter but includes more values to align with [RFC8984].

   Value Type  The value type for this property is TEXT.  The allowable
      values are defined below.

   Property Parameters  Non-standard or iana parameters can be specified
      on this property.

   Conformance  This property MUST be specified once within a
      "PARTICIPANT" component.

   Description  This property defines the type of participation, that is
      the roles the participant takes.

      It includes the values defined in [RFC8984].

      Note that the kind of participant, for example individual or
      group, is defined in the KIND property specified here.

      Some of the roles are required for the participant to be a
      schedulable object.  These are the roles that are shown below. *
      Do we need a separate registry or should we extend that one?

   Format Definition  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

   participanttype   = "PARTICIPANT-TYPE" partvalueparam ":"
                        partvalue
                        *("," partvalue) CRLF

   partvalue    = ("OWNER"
                  / "ATTENDEE"
                  / "OPTIONAL"
                  / "INFORMATIONAL"
                  / "CHAIR"
                  / "VOTER"
                  / "ACTIVE"
                  / "INACTIVE"
                  / "SPONSOR"
                  / "CONTACT"
                  / "BOOKING-CONTACT"
                  / "EMERGENCY-CONTACT"
                  / "PUBLICITY-CONTACT"
                  / "PLANNER-CONTACT"
                  / "PERFORMER"
                  / "SPEAKER"
                  / iana-token)     ; Other IANA-registered
                                    ; values

   partvalueparam   = *(";" other-param)

   The values other than VOTER have the same meaning as defined in
   [RFC8984] and [RFC9073].

   The VOTER roles value is used for a PARTICIPANT within a VPOLL to
   indicate a voting participant.

   Other roles defined here have no direct equivalent in [RFC5545]

   To map [RFC5545] ATTENDEE ROLE values to PARTICIPANT-TYPE or
   jsCalendar values use the following.

7.  iTip With Participants

   The PARTICIPANT component introduced in [RFC9073] with the addition
   of some properties defined in this specification mirrors the
   participant object in [RFC8984].

   For all existing schedulable and publishable components, VEVENT,
   VTODO, VFREEBUSY, and VAVAILABILITY; the ORGANIZER and ATTENDEE
   properties MUST be supplied as appropriate.  For new components such
   as VPOLL, defined here, only PARTICIPANT components MUST be used.

   Note that extensions to the [RFC5546] specification for VPOLL will be
   dealt with in later sections.

   A participant object that takes part in group scheduling MUST have
   the following characteristics:

   *  It MUST have a calendar address ([RFC5545] CALENDAR-ADDRESS,
      [RFC8984] calendarAddress).

   *  It must have one or more scheduling role defined.  (PARTICIPANT-
      TYPE or [RFC8984] role)

   Scheduling with PARTICIPANT components behaves exactly as with
   ATTENDEE and ORGANIZER properties.  When iTip specifies the setting
   of ATTENDEE or ORGANIZER parameters then the appropriate PARTICIPANT
   property will be set.

8.  iTIP Extensions

   This specification introduces a number of extensions to [RFC5546].
   In group scheduling the parties involved are organizer and attendees.
   In VPOLL the parties are owner and voter participants.

   For many of the iTip processing rules the voters take the place of
   attendees.

8.1.  Methods

   There are some extensions to the behavior of iTip methods for a VPOLL
   object and two new methods are defined.

    +================+================================================+
    | Method         | Description                                    |

    +----------------+------------------------------------------------+
    | REQUEST        | Each child component MUST have a POLL-ITEM-ID  |
    |                | property.  Each set of components with the     |
    |                | same POLL-ITEM-ID value represents one overall |
    |                | set of items to be voted on.                   |
    +----------------+------------------------------------------------+
    | REPLY          | There MUST be a single VPOLL component which   |
    |                | MUST have: either one or more POLL-ITEM-ID     |
    |                | properties with a RESPONSE param matching that |
    |                | from a REQUEST or a VFREEBUSY or VAVAILABILITY |
    |                | child component showing overall busy/available |
    |                | time.  The VPOLL MUST have one voter only.     |
    +----------------+------------------------------------------------+

    |                | UID matching that of the poll being cancelled. |
    +----------------+------------------------------------------------+
    | REFRESH        | The owner returns a METHOD:REQUEST with the    |
    |                | current full state, or a METHOD:CANCEL or an   |
    |                | error if no matching poll is found.            |
    +----------------+------------------------------------------------+
    | COUNTER        | Not supported for VPOLL.                       |

    | POLLSTATUS     | Used to send the current state of the poll to  |
    |                | all voters.  The VPOLL can contain a reduced   |

    |                | SEQUENCE (if not 0), UID and PARTICIPANTS.     |
    |                | One PARTICIPANT MUST be the owner.             |

8.3.1.  Methods for VPOLL Calendar Components

   This section defines the property set restrictions for the method
   types that are applicable to the "VPOLL" calendar component.  Each
   method is defined using a table that clarifies the property
   constraints that define the particular method.

   The presence column uses the following values to assert whether a
   property is required or optional, and the number of times it may
   appear in the iCalendar object.

   +================+=================================================+
   | Presence Value | Description                                     |
   +================+=================================================+
   | 1              | One instance MUST be present.                   |
   +----------------+-------------------------------------------------+
   | 1+             | At least one instance MUST be present.          |
   +----------------+-------------------------------------------------+
   | 0              | Instances of this property MUST NOT be present. |
   +----------------+-------------------------------------------------+
   | 0+             | Multiple instances MAY be present.              |
   +----------------+-------------------------------------------------+
   | 0 or 1         | Up to 1 instance of this property MAY be        |

   |            | view it as a PUBLISH.  REQUEST SHOULD NOT be         |
   |            | used just to set the status of the poll -            |

8.3.2.  Method: PUBLISH

   The "PUBLISH" method in a "VPOLL" calendar component is an
   unsolicited posting of an iCalendar object.  Any CU may add published
   components to their calendar.  An owner participant MUST be present
   in a published iCalendar component.  "Voters" MUST NOT be present.
   Its expected usage is for encapsulating an arbitrary poll as an
   iCalendar object.  The "Owner" may subsequently update (with another
   "PUBLISH" method) or cancel (with a "CANCEL" method) a previously
   published "VPOLL" calendar component.

   Note  Not clear how useful this is but needs some work on
      transmitting the current vote without any voter identification.

Internet-Draft                    VPOLL                       April 2024


   This method type has a "METHOD" property with the value "PUBLISH" and
   one or more complete VPOLL objects that conform to the property
   constraints defined in section Section 4.6.1.

8.3.3.  Method: REQUEST

   The "REQUEST" method in a "VPOLL" component provides the following
   scheduling functions:

   *  Invite "Voters" to respond to the poll.

   *  Change the items being voted upon.

   *  Complete or confirm the poll.

   *  Response to a "REFRESH" request.

   *  Update the details of an existing vpoll.

   *  Update the status of "Voters".

   *  Forward a "VPOLL" to another uninvited CU.

   *  For an existing "VPOLL" calendar component, delegate the role of
      "Voter" to another CU.

   *  For an existing "VPOLL" calendar component, change the role of
      "Owner" to another CU.

   The "Owner" originates the "REQUEST".  The recipients of the
   "REQUEST" method are the CUs voting in the poll, the "Voters".
   "Voters" use the "REPLY" method to convey votes to the "Owner".

   The "UID" and "SEQUENCE" properties are used to distinguish the
   various uses of the "REQUEST" method.  If the "UID" property value in
   the "REQUEST" is not found on the recipient's calendar, then the
   "REQUEST" is for a new "VPOLL" calendar component.  If the "UID"
   property value is found on the recipient's calendar, then the
   "REQUEST" is for an update, or a reconfirmation of the "VPOLL"
   calendar component.

   For the "REQUEST" method only a single iCalendar object is permitted.

   This method type has a "METHOD" property with the value "REQUEST" and
   a single complete VPOLL object that conforms to the property
   constraints defined in section Section 4.6.1.

8.3.3.1.  Rescheduling a poll

   The "REQUEST" method may be used to reschedule a poll, that is force
   a revote.  A rescheduled poll involves a change to the existing poll
   in terms of its time the components being voted on may have changed.
   If the recipient CUA of a "REQUEST" method finds that the "UID"
   property value already exists on the calendar but that the "SEQUENCE"
   (or "DTSTAMP") property value in the "REQUEST" method is greater than
   the value for the existing poll, then the "REQUEST" method describes
   a rescheduling of the poll.

8.3.3.2.  Updating or Reconfirmation of a Poll

   The "REQUEST" method may be used to update or reconfirm a poll.  An
   update to an existing poll does not involve changes to the time or
   candidates, and might not involve a change to the location or
   description for the poll.  If the recipient CUA of a "REQUEST" method
   finds that the "UID" property value already exists on the calendar
   and that the "SEQUENCE" property value in the "REQUEST" is the same
   as the value for the existing poll, then the "REQUEST" method
   describes an update of the poll details, but not a rescheduling of
   the POLL.

   The update "REQUEST" method is the appropriate response to a
   "REFRESH" method sent from a "Voter" to the "Owner" of a poll.

   The "Owner" of a poll may also send unsolicited "REQUEST" methods.
   The unsolicited "REQUEST" methods may be used to update the details
   of the poll without rescheduling it, to update the "RESPONSE"
   parameter of "Voters", or to reconfirm the poll.

8.3.3.3.  Confirmation of a Poll

   The "REQUEST" method may be used to confirm a poll, that is announce
   the winner in BASIC mode.  The STATUS MUST be set to CONFIRMED and
   for BASIC mode a VPOLL POLL-WINNER property must be provided with the
   poll-id of the winning component.

8.3.3.4.  Closing a Poll

   The "REQUEST" method may be used to close a poll, that is indicate
   voting is completed.  The STATUS MUST be set to COMPLETED.

8.3.3.5.  Delegating a Poll to Another CU

   Some calendar and scheduling systems allow "Voters" to delegate the
   vote to another "Calendar User". iTIP supports this concept using the
   following workflow.  Any "Voter" may delegate their right to vote in
   a poll to another CU.  The implication is that the delegate
   participates in lieu of the original "Voter", NOT in addition to the
   "Voter".  The delegator MUST notify the "Owner" of this action using
   the steps outlined below.  Implementations may support or restrict
   delegation as they see fit.  For instance, some implementations may
   restrict a delegate from delegating a "REQUEST" to another CU.

   The "Delegator" of a poll forwards the existing "REQUEST" to the
   "Delegate".  The "REQUEST" method MUST include a "Voter" property
   with the calendar address of the "Delegate".  The "Delegator" MUST
   also send a "REPLY" method to the "Owner" with the "Delegator's"
   "Voter" property "DELEGATED-TO" parameter set to the calendar address
   of the "Delegate".  Also, a new "Voter" property for the "Delegate"
   MUST be included and must specify the calendar user address set in
   the "DELEGATED-TO" parameter, as above.

   In response to the request, the "Delegate" MUST send a "REPLY" method
   to the "Owner", and optionally to the "Delegator".  The "REPLY"

   method SHOULD include the "Voter" participant with the "PARTICIPANT-
   DELEGATED-FROM" property value of the "Delegator's" calendar address.

   The "Delegator" may continue to receive updates to the poll even
   though they will not be attending.  This is accomplished by the
   "Delegator" setting their "role" attribute to "INFORMATIONAL" in the
   "REPLY" to the "Owner".

8.3.3.6.  Changing the Owner

   The situation may arise where the "Owner" of a "VPOLL" is no longer
   able to perform the "Owner" role and abdicates without passing on the
   "Owner" role to someone else.  When this occurs, the "Voters" of the
   "VPOLL" may use out-of-band mechanisms to communicate the situation
   and agree upon a new "Owner".  The new "Owner" should then send out a
   new "REQUEST" with a modified version of the "VPOLL" in which the
   "SEQUENCE" number has been incremented and the owner role assigned to
   the appropriate "PARTICIPANT".

Internet-Draft                    VPOLL                       April 2024


8.3.3.7.  Sending on Behalf of the Owner

   There are a number of scenarios that support the need for a "Calendar
   User" to act on behalf of the "Owner" without explicit role changing.
   This might be the case if the CU designated as "Owner" is sick or
   unable to perform duties associated with that function.  In these
   cases, iTIP supports the notion of one CU acting on behalf of
   another.  In the case where one CU sends on behalf of another CU, the
   "Voter" responses are still directed back towards the CU designated
   as "Owner".

8.3.3.8.  Forwarding to an Uninvited CU

   A "Voter" invited to a "VPOLL" calendar component may send the
   "VPOLL" calendar component to another new CU not previously
   associated with the "VPOLL" calendar component.  The current "Voter"
   participating in the "VPOLL" calendar component does this by
   forwarding the original "REQUEST" method to the new CU.  The new CU
   can send a "REPLY" to the "Owner" of the "VPOLL" calendar component.
   The reply contains a "Voter" participant component for the new CU.

   The "Owner" ultimately decides whether the new CU becomes part of the
   poll and is not obligated to do anything with a "REPLY" from a new
   (uninvited) CU.  If the "Owner" does not want the new CU to be part
   of the poll, the new "Voter" is not added to the "VPOLL" calendar
   component.  The "Owner" MAY send the CU a "CANCEL" message to
   indicate that they will not be added to the poll.

   If the "Owner" decides to add the new CU, a new participant for the
   "Voter" is added to the "VPOLL" calendar component.  Furthermore, the
   "Owner" is free to change any "Voter" participant property values
   from the values supplied by the new CU to something the "Owner"
   considers appropriate.  The "Owner" SHOULD send the new CU a
   "REQUEST" message to inform them that they have been added.

   When forwarding a "REQUEST" to another CU, the forwarding "Voter"
   MUST NOT make changes to the original message.

8.3.3.9.  Updating Voter Status

   The "Owner" of a poll may also request updated status from one or
   more "Voters".  The "Owner" sends a "REQUEST" method to the "Voter"
   and sets the "EXPECT-REPLY" property value to TRUE.  The "SEQUENCE"
   property for the poll is not changed from its previous value.  A
   recipient will determine that the only change in the "REQUEST" is
   that their "EXPECT-REPLY" property indicates a request for updated
   status.  The recipient SHOULD respond with a "REPLY" method
   indicating their current vote with respect to the "REQUEST".

Internet-Draft                    VPOLL                       April 2024


8.3.4.  Method: REPLY

   The "REPLY" method in a "VPOLL" calendar component is used to respond
   (e.g., accept or decline) to a "REQUEST" or to reply to a delegation
   "REQUEST".  When used to provide a delegation response, the
   "Delegator" SHOULD include the calendar address of the "Delegate" on
   the "DELEGATED-TO" property parameter of the "Delegator's" "CALENDAR-
   ADDRESS" property.  The "Delegate" SHOULD include the calendar
   address of the "Delegator" on the "DELEGATED-FROM" property parameter
   of the "Delegate's" "CALENDAR-ADDRESS" property.

   The "REPLY" method is also used when processing of a "REQUEST" fails.
   Depending on the value of the "REQUEST-STATUS" property, no action
   may have been performed.

   The "Owner" of a poll may receive the "REPLY" method from a CU not in
   the original "REQUEST".  For example, a "REPLY" may be received from
   a "Delegate" to a poll.  In addition, the "REPLY" method may be
   received from an unknown CU (a "Party Crasher").  This uninvited
   "Voter" may be accepted, or the "Owner" may cancel the poll for the
   uninvited "Voter" by sending a "CANCEL" method to the uninvited
   "Voter".

   A "Voter" MAY include a message to the "Owner" using the "COMMENT"
   property in the PARTICIPANT component.  For example, if the user
   indicates a low interest and wants to let the "Owner" know why, the
   reason can be expressed in the "COMMENT" property value.

   The "Owner" may also receive a "REPLY" from one CU on behalf of
   another.  Like the scenario enumerated above for the "Owner",
   "Voters" may have another CU respond on their behalf.  This is done
   using the "SENT-BY" parameter.

   The optional properties listed in the table below (those listed as
   "0+" or "0 or 1") MUST NOT be changed from those of the original
   request.  (But see comments on VFREEBUSY and VAVAILABILITY)

   This method type has a "METHOD" property with the value "REPLY" and a
   single VPOLL object.  That object MUST contain the properties shown
   below.  All other properties or components SHOULD NOT be present and
   MUST be ignored by the recipient if present.

8.3.5.  Method: CANCEL

   The "CANCEL" method in a "VPOLL" calendar component is used to send a
   cancellation notice of an existing poll request to the affected
   "Voters".  The message is sent by the "Owner" of the poll.

   The "Owner" MUST send a "CANCEL" message to each "Voter" affected by
   the cancellation.  This can be done using a single "CANCEL" message
   for all "Voters" or by using multiple messages with different subsets
   of the affected "Voters" in each.

   When a "VPOLL" is cancelled, the "SEQUENCE" property value MUST be
   incremented as described in Section 8.2.3.

   Once a CANCEL message has been sent to all voters no further voting
   may take place.  The poll is considered closed.

   This method type has a "METHOD" property with the value "CANCEL" and
   one or more VPOLL objects.  Those objects MUST contain the properties
   shown below.  All other properties or components SHOULD NOT be
   present and MUST be ignored by the recipient if present.

   the poll "Owner".  The "REFRESH" method MUST specify the "UID"
   property of the poll to update.  The "Owner" responds with a
   METHOD=REQUEST giving the latest status and version of the poll.

8.3.7.  Method: POLLSTATUS

   The "POLLSTATUS" method in a "VPOLL" calendar component is used to
   inform recipients of the current status of the poll in a compact
   manner.  The "Owner" participant MUST be present in the confirmed
   poll component.  All "Voters" MUST be present.  The selected
   component(s) according to the poll mode SHOULD NOT be present in the
   poll component.  Clients receiving this message may store the
   confirmed items in their calendars.

9.  CalDAV Extensions

   This specification extends [RFC4791] in that it defines a new
   component and new iCalendar properties to be supported and requires
   extra definitions related to time-ranges and reports.

   Additionally, it extends [RFC6638] as it a VPOLL component is a
   schedulable entity.

9.1.  Calendar Collection Properties

   This section defines new CalDAV properties for calendar collections.

9.1.1.  CALDAV:supported-vpoll-component-sets

   Name  supported-vpoll-component-sets

   Namespace  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav

   Purpose  Specifies the calendar component types (e.g., VEVENT, VTODO,

      etc.) and combination of types that may be included in a VPOLL
      component.

   Conformance  This property MAY be defined on any calendar collection.
      If defined, it MUST be protected and SHOULD NOT be returned by a
      PROPFIND DAV:allprop request (as defined in Section 12.14.1 of
      [RFC2518]).

   Description  The CALDAV:supported-vpoll-component-sets property is
      used to specify restrictions on the calendar component types that
      VPOLL components may contain in a calendar collection.

      It also specifies the combination of allowed component types.

      Any attempt by the client to store VPOLL components with component
      types or combinations of types not listed in this property, if it
      exists, MUST result in an error, with the CALDAV:supported-vpoll-
      component-sets precondition Section 9.2 being violated.  Since
      this property is protected, it cannot be changed by clients using
      a PROPPATCH request.  However, clients can initialize the value of
      this property when creating a new calendar collection with
      MKCALENDAR.  In the absence of this property, the server MUST
      accept all component types, and the client can assume that all
      component types are accepted.

   Purpose  Provides a numeric value indicating the maximum number of
      items that may be contained in any instance of a VPOLL calendar
      object resource stored in the calendar collection.

   Conformance  This property MAY be defined on any calendar collection.

   Conformance  This property MAY be defined on any calendar collection.
      If defined, it MUST be protected and SHOULD NOT be returned by a

   Each section of Appendix A "Scheduling Privileges Summary" is
   extended to include VPOLL.

   Any reference to the ATTENDEE property should be read to include the
   CALENDAR-ADDRESS property contained in the PARTICIPANT compoents.
   That is, for scheduling purposes the CALENDAR-ADDRESS property is
   handled in exactly the same manner as the ATTENDEE property.

9.2.  Additional Preconditions for PUT, COPY, and MOVE

   This specification creates additional Preconditions for PUT, COPY,
   and MOVE methods.  These preconditions apply when a PUT operation of
   a VPOLL calendar object resource into a calendar collection occurs,
   or when a COPY or MOVE operation of a calendar object resource into a
   calendar collection occurs, or when a COPY or MOVE operation occurs
   on a calendar collection.

   The new preconditions are:

   (CALDAV:supported-vpoll-component-sets)  The VPOLL resource submitted
      in the PUT request, or targeted by a COPY or MOVE request, MUST
      contain a type or combination of calendar component that is
      supported in the targeted calendar collection;

   (CALDAV:vpoll-max-items)  The VPOLL resource submitted in the PUT
      request, or targeted by a COPY or MOVE request, MUST have a number
      of sub-components (excluding VTIMEZONE) less than or equal to the
      value of the CALDAV:vpoll-max-items property value Section 9.1.2
      on the calendar collection where the resource will be stored;

   (CALDAV:vpoll-max-active)  The PUT request, or COPY or MOVE request,
      MUST not result in the number of active VPOLLs being greater than
      the value of the CALDAV:vpoll-max-active property value
      Section 9.1.3 on the calendar collection where the resource will
      be stored;

   (CALDAV:vpoll-max-voters)  The VPOLL resource submitted in the PUT
      request, or targeted by a COPY or MOVE request, MUST have a number
      of voters represented by PARTICIPANT components less than or equal
      to the value of the CALDAV:vpoll-max-voters property value
      Section 9.1.4 on the calendar collection where the resource will
      be stored;

9.3.  CalDAV:calendar-query Report

   This allows the retrieval of VPOLLs and their included components.
   The query specification allows queries to be directed at the
   contained sub-components.  For VPOLL queries this feature is
   disallowed.  Time-range queries can only target the vpoll component
   itself.

Internet-Draft                    VPOLL                       April 2024


9.3.1.  Example: Partial Retrieval of VPOLL

   In this example, the client requests the server to return specific
   components and properties of the VPOLL components that overlap the
   time range from December 4, 2012, at 00:00:00 A.M.  UTC to December
   5, 2012, at 00:00:00 A.M.  UTC.  In addition, the DAV:getetag
   property is also requested and returned as part of the response.
   Note that due to the CALDAV: calendar-data element restrictions, the
   DTSTAMP property in VPOLL components has not been returned, and the
   only property returned in the VCALENDAR object is VERSION.

9.4.  CalDAV time ranges

   "CALDAV:time-range XML Element" in Section 9.9 of [RFC4791] describes
   how to specify time ranges to limit the set of calendar components
   returned by the server.  This specification extends [RFC4791] to
   describe the meaning of time ranges for VPOLL

   A VPOLL component is said to overlap a given time range if the
   condition for the corresponding component state specified in the
   table below is satisfied.  The conditions depend on the presence of
   the DTSTART, DURATION, DTEND, COMPLETED and CREATED properties in the
   VPOLL component.  Note that, as specified above, the DTEND value MUST
   be a DATE-TIME value equal to or after the DTSTART value if
   specified.

Appendix A.  Open issues

   public-comment: Not documented and was a parameter on something.
   Really sounds like a PARTICIPANT or VOTE property

   Notifications: Need to do a section on what Notifications to support.
   A.  VPOLL is about to end and you haven't voted on it yet.  Instead
   reuse VALARMS to notify the user?

   Future: Restarting a confirmed/completed VPOLL What to do with
   changes to STATUS:CONFIRMED?  Allow them or not?  What do to that
   poll had a winning event or todo.  Stress VPOLL UID MUST be unique
   Changing status back from CONFIRMED MUST adjust status of any events
   booked as a result of confirmation.  MUST winning event be cancelled
   for POLL-MODE basic?  No - voter has indicated now unable to attend -
   want to revote

Internet-Draft                    VPOLL                       April 2024


   Future: Voting on a confirmed/completed VPOLL Can a voter vote after
   completion?  May be unable to attend and wants to indicate.  Requires
   retention of VPOLL retention period Removed status

   ORGANIZER/ATTENDEE validity Can a user create a poll with scheduled
   events where that user's isn't the organizer of the poll?  So is
   there a requirement that the account that poll is on is able to
   create each one of the resources in the poll? i.e. I can't create a
   poll with a set of events where I am just the attendee of the events.
   Are there any other restrictions for components in a VPOLL?  Add to
   security consideration

   Update to existing event after poll confirm When voting on existing
   event - winning properties ONLY are merged in to the real event.

A.1.  Advertising tasks

   Use VPOLL for advertising a task to a pool of possible ATTENDEEs and
   then select the respondent to assign one or more assignees.

   Introduce POLL-MODE:ASSIGNMENT

   Need to indicate number of assignees required.

   Potentially different types of response e.g.  ACCEPT or DECLINE, or a
   weighting e.g. 0 - 100

   Take into FREEBUSY discussion.

   Need to write down what isn't valid in a VPOLL
   a.  Can't change POLL-MODE

   Guide for ATTENDEE roles chair, NON-PARTICIPANT etc

   ? - some iTip notes On confirm - send itip if appropriate (PUBLISH) -
   all non-participating - shared - feeds Organizer can specify where
   result is?  Confirm can specify that itip is sent - ITIP / NONE -
   parameter ?  on POLL-WINNER

   Need to add example of freebusy in response
